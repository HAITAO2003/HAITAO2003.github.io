            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a final year student at NUS specialising in AI and computer science. My current research focus is in reinforcement learning and its applications 
                to automated portfolio management and high frequency trading systems by modeling them as decision-making systems. My journey in RL began during my undergraduate research, 
                where I became fascinated by the idea of agents learning through interaction, and even achieving superhuman performance in various tasks.

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS), 
                with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. Through my undergraduate research and coursework, 
                I've developed a strong foundation in machine learning, with a particular passion for reinforcement learning 
                and its real-world applications.
